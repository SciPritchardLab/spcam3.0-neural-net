<H2>2.7 Troubleshooting Guide</H2>
This section presents information which should help with some common problems
users encounter when running the CAM.
<A name=PLATFORMS></A>
<H4>2.7.1 Platforms CAM2.0.2 ported to</H4>
CAM2.0.2 is fully ported and supported on the IBM-SP, SGI-Origin, Solaris, Compaq-alpha-cluster,
and Linux-PC with the Portland group FORTRAN-90 and "C" compilers, Linux-PC with the Lahey 
compiler, and Linux-PC with Portland group FORTRAN-90 and the GNU "C" compilers.
<A name=BUGS></A>
<H4>2.7.2 Known problems</H4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Potential problem on all platforms getting environment variables when
running with distributed memory parallelism (SPMD mode).
<p>
The model code requires that certain environment variables be available.
When running in "SPMD mode" each processing task has to establish these
values. Some machines have trouble when processing slaves try to get environment 
variables. For example, using the UNIX shell "bash" on a Linux platform
with the Lahey compiler -- the model fails since the slave processes are
unable to obtain the environment variables. This problem can be related to 
the UNIX shell that the user is using. Running on Linux with the Lahey compiler
and the "tcsh" shell doesn't cause the same problem that running "bash" does.
Users are cautioned that other combinations of UNIX shells and platforms may 
result in this same problem.
<li>Problem compiling "history.F90" on IBM-SP with DEBUG mode and SPMD on.
<p>
The model has undergone extensive testing on IBM platforms both at NCAR and
at several other institutions. One problem discovered is a problem compiling
the "history.F90" module when using the more extensive "DEBUG mode" compiler
options (this mode is enabled by setting the environment variable DEBUG to "TRUE")
and with the SPMD distributed memory configuration. The compiler will
sometimes abort with the error "INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR". This problem is
due to a problem with the IBM FORTRAN-90 compiler, and has been reported
to IBM. In many cases this problem is inconsistent, so recompiling will
sometimes (not always) work. As a work around the user could also compile
"history.F90" without the DEBUG option on. This problem was reported to IBM
and they have fixed the problem in newer versions of the compiler (or with
the appropriate "E-fixes" applied to older compilers).
<li>Problem building ESMF library with some versions of gmake.
<p>
Certain versions of gmake have been shown to have trouble with date-stamps.
The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) library has trouble with these versions
and will not build.  The version of gmake with the fix is 3.79.1, the bug
was introduced somewhere between 3.78.1 and 3.79. So to fix the problem you
merely need to update to a newer version.
</ul>
<A name=CONTROL></A>
<H4>2.7.3 General</H4>
The first step in troubleshooting a failed model run is to check the basics.&nbsp;
Look at the logs for error messages.&nbsp; Make sure the model executable
is up to date with any source code changes.&nbsp; Rebuild the model cleanly
(i.e. issue a "gmake clean" before rerunning the script)
if you are unsure of the state of any code. Ask yourself what has changed
since the last successful run.
<P>Other times CAM may fail for no obvious reason or perhaps the error
message returned is cryptic or misleading.&nbsp; It has been our experience
that the majority of these types of symptoms can be attributed to an incorrect
allocation of hardware and/or software resources (e.g. the user sets the
value of $OMP_NUM_THREADS to a value inconsistent with the number of physical
CPUs per node). Most often an incorrect setting
for the per-thread stack size will cause the model to fail with a segmentation
fault, allocation error, or stack pointer error.&nbsp; Usually the default
setting for this resource is too low and must be adjusted by setting the
appropriate environment variables.&nbsp; Values in the range of 40-70 Mbytes
seem to work well on most architectures.&nbsp; As a simple troubleshooting
step the user may try adjusting this resource, or the process stack size,
for their particular application.&nbsp; Here is a list of suggested runtime
resource settings affecting the process and/or thread stack sizes.
<H4><A NAME="STACK"></A>2.7.4 How to increase the stacksize on different platforms</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Compaq

<BLOCKQUOTE>limit stacksize unlimited
<BR>setenv MP_STACK_SIZE 17000000</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>IBM
<BLOCKQUOTE>limit stack size unlimited
<BR>setenv XLSMPOPTS "stack=40000000"</BLOCKQUOTE>

</UL>
<H4><A NAME="SEC2.7_5"></A>2.7.5 General problems on different platforms</H4>
Most distributed-memory platforms also provide runtime settings to enable
a user to override the multiprocessing defaults and customize the machine
parallelism to a particular application.&nbsp; CAM performance can be adversely
affected by an incorrect configuration of the machine parallelism.&nbsp;
The run scripts provided in the distribution create an executable that
will run in a hybrid mode on distributed architectures, using MPI for communication
between nodes and OpenMP directives on processes within a node.&nbsp; When
running in hybrid mode the user should set the number of MPI tasks per
node to be 1.&nbsp; Thread-based OpenMP multitasking will utilize all processors
on the node.&nbsp; If the user makes the appropriate changes to the Makefile
to disable OpenMP and use only MPI, the number of MPI tasks per node should
be set equal to the number of physical processors per node.
<P>In addition to properly configuring machine resources, we've identified
the following problems often encountered when building and running CAM
on the machines here at NCAR.
<UL>
<LI>PC/Linux

<UL>
<LI>
The number of underscore characters appended to Fortran external names
is different for default configurations of the NetCDF and MPI libraries.&nbsp;
libnetcdf.a wants to build with 1 underscore appended to Fortran external
names, while libmpich.a wants to build with 2.&nbsp; The default CAM build
procedure assumes 1 underscore. You can change this by adding the compiler
directive "-Msecond_underscore" to the environment variable "USER_FLAGS".
This directive produces objects with subroutine names have two underscores
appended.</LI>
