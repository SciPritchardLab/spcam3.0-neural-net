Description:

Checklist of items to go over in the documentation for the CCM3.5 release
This is basically just a list of the table of contents with a few extra items
thrown in.  People sign up for items and mark when they are checked off.


=================================================================================

See the README file for standard practice of file conversion, dealing with CVS
and the general setup and management of these files.

Sign up for an item by putting your name in the "assign" column.
After you're finished changing an item and have checked it in, mark the "Chngd"
(changed) column.  After that point someone else should review it.  Dave and 
the other scientists will of course review the whole thing, but we should check
each others work as we go along.  Some of the items in the list only require 
some review, others require complete reworking including possibly adding and 
changing sections.  Adding sections is something we should do with group planning
and effort, to ensure the final document is cohesive and well thought out.
Also if you realize there are additional items that should be checked go ahead
and add them to this list.

Finalize the CCM3.0 HTML and Word-97 copies		Erik	----	----

(MUST be done before we start our final edits to ensure that the current plan of
going back and forth between Word and HTML is a good one).

Make sure all links work					Erik	----	----
Make sure all images appear					Erik	----	----
Ensure we can convert into and out of Word-97 easily	Erik	----	----
Get a paper copy that works well				Paulad ----   ----
Ensure all code fragments/output/input are updated	----	----	----
Ensure references to machines are updated.		----	----	----

(ie. list of machines we support and antero rather than Shavano etc.)
