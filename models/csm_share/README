Description of csm_share:

	This module contains codes that are shared between the different 
model compenents of CSM.  As such these codes are part of the interface protocol
of CSM.  Codes are currently in two classes.  Either they are codes dealing with 
the message passing interface that is required to be consistent between all 
codes.  Or, the codes are physics that is required to be consistent between
all models.  For example, the solar zenith and orbital calculations MUST be
the same in all models, therefore these codes are shared in this one place.
