INTRODUCTION TO CAM2
------------ -- ----

The NCAR Community Atmospheric Model (CAM2) is a stable, efficient, documented,
state of the art, atmospheric general circulation model designed for climate
research on high-speed supercomputers and select upper-end workstations.

CAM2 is a free resource for scientists and graduate students in a wide array 
of specialties to use for conducting global modeling experiments in their
particular area of expertise without spending decades of their careers
developing a global climate model.

CAM2 was developed based on the Community Climate Model (CCM). Over the last 15 years, 
the CCM has been used by a wide variety of scientific institutions around the 
world for basic research into such areas as nuclear winter, climate predictability, 
atmospheric chemistry, paleoclimate, biosphere-atmosphere transfer, CO2 warming, 
climate prediction and climate change. CAM2 extends the legacy of version 3 of the 
CCM code (CCM3), especially for use with simulations coupled to the CCSM. CAM2 is 
based from CCM3, but has many substantial updates including both code-changes as well 
as scientific changes.

For the latest information, documentation and updates on CAM2 see the CAM2 web page at.

This includes links to the on-line version of the CAM2 documentation (and ways to
down-load paper copies) as well as information on the CAM2 e-mail discussion group
"cam-users". The "cam-users" e-mail list will announce all new model releases, 
and information and patches regarding bug-fixes.  It is also a forum for users of 
the CAM to discuss issues of relevance to using the model.
