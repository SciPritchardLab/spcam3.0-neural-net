One-line summary: Add asynchronous messaging option, make 
   modules public/private, add unit tests, add more platforms
Changes made:

shr_msg_mod has an asynchronous messaging option. 

Make all modules more careful about declaring data and methods 
public or private. In general try to make all modules private 
with explicit declarations on public data and methods. shr_msg_mod 
is still public as it includes "mpif.h" which is assumed to be 
included by most other models.

Add "unit_testers" directory with a few useful unit tests.

Allow shr_sys_mod to work on more platforms: SunOS, and Linux.

One-line summary: Change case of kind parameters, add OSF capability.
Changes made:

 Tony upgraded the share library for the Compaq. 

 "convert isend to send in shr_msg_mod.F90
 add OSF (compaq) system calls to shr_sys_mod.F90 and shr_timer_mod.F90"

 Change case of kind parameters to upper-case. This seemed to be an 
 issue on the SGI. I don't think case-sensitivity is in the FORTRAN standard, 
 but the parameters are addressed as upper-case, and it certainly shouldn't 
 hurt anything.

One-line summary: Add print flag as argument to orb_params / 
	add a spare coupler compatiblity message #'s
Changes made:

	Added a argument to orb_params to determine if you want
to print messages out or not.  Normally this should be set to
true, but if you are running a program under SPMD you will want
the master to set it to true and the slaves set it to false.
Otherwise, all the processesors print out the same messages.

	Added a list of coupler compatibility message numbers.
that are set and can be used as the coupler changes.  These 
values can not be changed at this point!

Changes made:

	Change orbit so that either IYEAR_AD or (ECCEN,OBLIQ,MVELP) has
to be set rather than specifying defaults. This makes it much more clear
what the orbital parameters are set to, since the user HAS to enter it
as a required namelist item.  If the parameters aren't set, a long message
comes up that displays what possible values might be.

One-line summary: Changed directory structure to be reduced

Changes made:

	Simply moved files around to accomidate a new directory 
structure.  MPI/msg_wrapper.F was moved to msg/mpi_msg_wrapper.F.
Other files were moved from "orbit" into the main directory.  So
now there are only two directories -- the main "csm_share" directory
and the one sub-directory "msg" for the files dealing with the 
message passing interface.

Model: SHARE
Version: SHARE1.0.2
One-line summary: Moved files to subdirectories, added msgid for cpl, 
		added receive for char.
Changes made:

o Moved files to subdirectories.  

	By doing this we can easily pick which set
of functions each model needs to share, and we can swap out different packages.
For example, we can easily pick a different message passing library by 
compiling the interface routine in the PVM sub-directory for example.  Also
we can place functions dealing with non-NCAR machines here and only add them
in the list to compile if we are at a non-NCAR site.

Subdirectories:
	msg ----- generic message passing files (non-library dependent)
	orbit --- subroutines dealing with the earths orbit. Solar declination,
			Solar zenith angle, and eath-sun distance factor.
	MPI ----- subroutines interfacing to the MPI message passing library.

Updated the README file to document the above changes.  Also suggest names
for other sub-directories to add later (constants, MSS etc.).

o Added a task identifier for the coupler in msgid.h: MSGID_TID_CPL

o Added the character receive function to the MPI msg_wrapper.F (msg_recv_c).

Model: SHARE
Version: SHARE1.0
One-line summary: Initial version, orbit and message compatability.
Changes made:

Initial version of the shared CSM library.

The purpose of this library is to archive all the code used by CSM models
THAT HAS TO BE THE SAME!  This way we have one location to look for code
that is shared.  So the earth's orbital parameters, and message passing
type codes are archived here.  Other codes regarding the calender and
physical constants could also be put here as well.  This helps to ensure
that models have the same expressions for functions shared across the board.
It is also a more efficient programming paradigm.  And finally it makes it
easier for other models to link into CSM, since all of the interface
requirements are packaged up into one location.

Currently the codes that are here are in three classes...

Orbit:

	Orbital codes to calculate earths' orbital parameters and get solar
	declination angle, earth-sun distance factor, and cosine of the solar 
	zenith angle.

Message Compatability:

	These codes check the messages from the coupler and ensure that the
	version of the coupler messages is compatable with the version
	that is expected.

README/ChangeLog/ChangeSum:

	The README file gives some background on why we created this module
	and how we want/need to manage it.

	ChangeLog gives a long description of changes made.

	ChangeSum is a one-line description of changes made.

At this point only the atmosphere and land components are accessing these
codes, but later all models will use all or part of the codes shared here.
